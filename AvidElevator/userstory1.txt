As a passenger I need to call lift so that lift come to me.

+ lift should come when I call it
+ should be open when lift comes
- should be an indicator when lift is broken
- As a passenger I need to see lift state
- several calls
- check invalid floor number
+ what if lift on the same floor?
- lift should come to any valid floor
- lift should close doors when moving
- do we need to create lift anytime in tests?
