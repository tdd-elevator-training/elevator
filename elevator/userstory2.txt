as a passenger I need to select desired floor so that have ability to get into specified floor.

test list
+ door should be closed after selecting floor
- same floor is selected - door should be open
- door should open on specified floor
- selected floor is out of building floors range - exception expected
+ два поля liftWithOpenDoor liftWithClosedDoor, чтобы не копипастить
- extract assertTrue(doorisOpen) aasertFalse(doorisOpen)
